- Add caching for page responses that get invalidated when we make a new post or whatever
- Rewrite login page in leptos w/ auto-rerouting based on referrer ref
	- Maybe add a hidden field of the form that contains the referrer so it's included as part of the login POST. Then if it's not included, we just redirect to main login page.
- Rewrite edit page in leptos with same functionality
- Make a little table on the wedding admin page about total rsvp'd size, total invited size, estimated size accounting for current rsvp rate, etc.
- Make table/field names based on constants - don't just trust everything to be correct each time
- Maybe consider contributing to leptos to make compiles fail if `ActionForm`s don't contain all the necessary field names
- Clear current inputs in new guest form when it's submitted
- Contribute to leptos to note that if you're running into an issue with wasm panicking, make sure the output of your html when you inspect it in the browser is exactly what you're actually trying to render.
	- If e.g. it inserts a `<tbody>` around the contents of your `<table>` inner html when you're not explicitly rendering that in the `view` macro, then that could be causing an issue.
	- Also if you're trying to re-insert a `<!DOCTYPE>` or `<head>` somewhere nested inside a `<body>`, that will also cause issues.
- Check invitee emails and fill them in automatically if they already submitted in announcement recipients
